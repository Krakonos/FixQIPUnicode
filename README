FixQIPUnicode
=============

This is a simple plugin to search & replace badly encoded characters
in czech alphabet sent by QIP 2005. You will need git version of Psi with
plugins enabled (disabled by default) to use it, as the plugins are work
in progress and as of now (Octobe 25., 2009) still unstable.

You will also need a patch to Psi, that allows plugins to change message 
content. This patch is not invasive, it does in fact just remove "const" 
operator in plugin interface. This patch can be found at:

http://psi-dev.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/patches/520-psi-fix-ability-to-modify-events-from-plugins.diff

The patch is also submitted to Psi as Feature #79:
